Penguins Data Analysis

Overview

This repository contains a basic data exploration and correlation analysis of the popular Palmer Penguins dataset. The dataset is comprised of measurements of penguins collected from three species: Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. 

The dataset includes the following variables:

    species: The species of penguin (Adélie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo).
    island: The island where the penguin was observed (Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen).
    bill_length_mm: The length of the penguin's bill in millimeters.
    bill_depth_mm: The depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters.
    flipper_length_mm: The length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters.
    body_mass_g: The body mass of the penguin in grams.
    sex: The sex of the penguin (male, female, or NaN).

Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

    Data Cleaning: Ensuring no missing values and ensuring data consistency.
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the distribution of various features and exploring relationships between 2 variables.
    Summary Statistics: Calculating basic statistical summaries to gain insights into the dataset.
    Correlation Analysis: Illustrating the correlation (r) between two data set variables.
